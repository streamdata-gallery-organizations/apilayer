  company aiming to help developers, startups and larger companies automate and outsource
  complex processes by serving them with dedicated and handy programming interfaces
  - in short, APIs. Our goal is to offer quick and simple access to our software with
  the objective of speeding up development of your applications and easing the burden
  on your back-end. Our team has the opportunity to rethink how business processes
  work and how they can be improved, and we are thrilled to be building an entire
  platform dedicated to allowing companies to focus on what really matters.
